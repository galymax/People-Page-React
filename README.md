You are a Frontend Developer and have been tasked to refactor an existing page to use React. Please read the instructions and make the changes to the page code accordingly.

Instructions
1. To be able to run `create-react-app` copy the project files to a folder outside this one. Then run `npx create-react-app .` (`.` signals that the react files shall be created in the current folder)
2. Create the following (functional) components in the `components` folder:
    1. **Header**
    2. **Welcome**
    3. **Services**
    4. **Footer**
3. Use the appropriate parts of the original `index.html` to create the JSX for each component.
4. Move the images to the `public` folder and update the paths in JSX
5. Divide the original CSS file into individual CSS files for each component and import them in the respective components.
6. You can include the external CSS by adding the links in `index.html` in the `public` folder

## Bonus
1. Rename the CSS files to `.scss` extension and refactor the CSS to Sass (Nested selectors).
2. Put all text contents of the Components in the state and embed it in the JSX.
